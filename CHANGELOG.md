Notable changes in each release. Version numbers follow

## 1.0.0 (2026-11-07)

The first release.

- **Overview page:** live generation mix, demand, carbon intensity, wholesale
  price, grid frequency and interconnector flows, with 24-hour, 7-day and
  30-day history and the cleanest times to use electricity over the next day.
- **Regional carbon intensity** for any of NESO's 17 regions, with that
  region's generation mix and an explanation when it sits at 0 g/kWh.
- **Map page:** modelled output of each grid-connected power station, live
  interconnector flows, zoom, pan and full screen.
- **Stations page:** output by nation and by fuel, every station with its
  capacity and a 24-hour history, and the units that couldn't be placed.
- **Image:** `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`, Python standard library only,
  runs as a non-root user with a read-only root filesystem.
